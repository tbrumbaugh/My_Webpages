        <h1>Thoughts on Knowledge</h1>
	<p>People have had numerous different purposes and drives in there life. People feel most confortable in a setting or amongst people that they know. High achievement confirms the sense that our intuition and thoughts are correct. We may continue to crave a substance and want to know that feeling again.</p>
	<p>A question people may enevitably ask is are our thoughts correct? Are they justified? Is that the point of knowledge or is it the actual feeling? These are important questions that Philosophers delve into with immense complexity. However, that is not my goal for today. Today, I would like to pose a simpler thought on what creates knowledge at its core. It stems from our mortality. As animals, we wish to know 2 things:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>What is? (What is the current state of everything?)</li>
	    	<li>How will it change? (How will the current state evolve?)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Once we know the answer to these two questions we will undoubtedly ask an obvious question. How can I change what I do not like? This seems to be a very self seek, yet honest response to these to questions. We hope to gain knowledge in order to determine our fates. To transfrom ourselves from the mere pawns of the world to kings to gods.</p>
