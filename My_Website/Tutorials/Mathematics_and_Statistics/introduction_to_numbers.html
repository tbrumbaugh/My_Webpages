	        <h1>Introduction to Natural Numbers</h1>
	        <p>The "natural numbers" are a fancy name for the group on numbers 1,2,3,4,5,... In math we call this object a set, &naturals; = {1,2,3,...}. We develope this set by simply taking 1 and continually adding 1 giving a new element of the set. Once, we continue this process indefinetly we have the entire set.</p>

		<h1>Introduction to the Whole Numbers</h1>
		<p>Next, we extend this set to a set called the "whole numbers". This set is the naturals with 0 in it. Written in math notation &naturals; &cup; {0}.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h1>Introduction to the Integer Numbers</h1>
		<p>Next, next we introduce the idea of a negation. We then define a set called the "integer numbers" to be the "whole numbers" and the negative "natural numbers". This is equivalent the saying the "natural numbers" and 0 and the negative "natural numbers". Succintly put in math notation, &integers; = -&naturals; &cup; {0} &cup; &naturals;.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h1>Introduction to the Rational Numbers</h1>
		<p>Furthermore, we develop a set known as the "rational numbers" which have the form &rationals; = { m / n | m, n &isin; &integers; &and; n &ne; 0} </p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h1>Introduction to the Real Numbers</h1>
		<p>Subsequently, we take all of the limits points of sequence of "rational numbers" and we are given a new set known as the "real numbers", which is denoted as &reals;.</p>
