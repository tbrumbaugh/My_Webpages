                <h1>History of Geometry</h1>
		<p>Geometry arose naturally in many different cultures around the world natural as a practical way of dealing with matters of lengths, areas, and volumes. Therefore, people attempted to further formalize the subject and the emergence of an axiomatic form was created by Euclid in his treatment, "Element's". Geometry continued to expand over the centuries and has been incorporated into various different fields.</p>
