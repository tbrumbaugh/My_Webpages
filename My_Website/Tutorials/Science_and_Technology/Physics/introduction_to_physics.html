	<h1>Introduction to Physics</h1>

	<h2>Introduction to Classical Mechanics>
	<p>
		People dating back millenia studied the world around them attempting to determine patterns that they saw.
		Useful innovations in the fields of astronomy and engineering where achieved.
		This was due to the creation and formalization of the mathematical field of geometry, which developed the concepts of:
		<ul>
			<li>shape</li>
		    	<li>size</li>
            		<li>relative position of figures</li>
	    		<li>properties of space.</li>
		</ul>
	</p> 
	<p>
		The word "Physics" derives from the ancient greek work "physis" meaning <b>"nature"</b>.
		There are 2 fundemental questions we will be asking in Physics:
		<ul>
			<li>What is the state of the system?( what is the world around us)</li>
			<li>how will it evolve?( what will be the future states?)</li>
		</ul>
		Therefore, physics can be considered the most general science and all other sciences can be considered to be
		subfields of physics.
